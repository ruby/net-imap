## [v0.5.7](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.5.7) (2025-04-22)

### What's Changed

This release adds two features to prevent unbounded memory use: the `response_handlers` keyword argument to [`Net::IMAP.new`](https://ruby.github.io/net-imap/Net/IMAP.html#method-c-new) (#419) so response handlers can be added before the server can send any responses, and the [`max_response_size`](https://ruby.github.io/net-imap/Net/IMAP.html#attribute-i-max_response_size) config attribute (#444).

> [!NOTE]
> The default `max_response_size` is extremely high, to avoid issues with secure connections to trusted servers that are well-behaved.  It can be configured more conservatively to guard against untrusted servers (for example, connecting to user-provided hostnames).  _It is the responsibility of `net-imap` users to configure their client appropriately for the server they are connecting to._

## [v0.5.6](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.5.6) (2025-02-07)

### What's Changed
#### 🔒 Security Fix
Fixes CVE-2025-25186 (GHSA-7fc5-f82f-cx69): A malicious server can exhaust client memory by sending `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses with very large `uid-set` ranges. `Net::IMAP::UIDPlusData` expands these ranges into arrays of integers.

##### Fix with minor API changes

Set `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data` to `false` to replace `UIDPlusData` with `AppendUIDData` and `CopyUIDData`.  These classes store their UIDs as `Net::IMAP::SequenceSet` objects (_not_ expanded into arrays of integers).  Code that does not handle `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses should not see any difference.  Code that does handle these responses _may_ need to be updated.

For v0.3.8, this option is not available
For v0.4.19, the default value is `true`.
For v0.5.6, the default value is `:up_to_max_size`.
For v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be `false`  _(`UIDPlusData` will be removed from v0.6)_.

##### Mitigate with backward compatible API
Adjust `config.parser_max_deprecated_uidplus_data_size` to limit the maximum `UIDPlusData` UID set size.
When `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == true`, larger sets will crash.
When  `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == :up_to_max_size`, larger sets will use `AppendUIDData` or `CopyUIDData`.

For v0.3,8, this limit is _hard-coded_ to 10,000.
For v0.4.19, this limit defaults to 1000.
For v0.5.6, this limit defaults to 100.
For v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be `0`  _(`UIDPlusData` will be removed from v0.6)_.

##### Please Note: unhandled responses
If the client does not add response handlers to prune unhandled responses, a malicious server can still eventually exhaust all client memory, by repeatedly sending malicious responses.  However, `net-imap` has always retained unhandled responses, and it has always been necessary for long-lived connections to prune these responses.  This is not significantly different from connecting to a trusted server with a long-lived connection.  To limit the maximum number of retained responses, a simple handler might look something like the following:

  ```ruby
  limit = 1000
  imap.add_response_handler do |resp|
    next unless resp.respond_to?(:name) && resp.respond_to?(:data)
    name = resp.name
    code = resp.data.code&.name if resp.data.is_a?(Net::IMAP::ResponseText)
    imap.responses(name) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }
    imap.responses(code) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }
  end
  ```

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.5.0) (2024-10-16)

### What's Changed

#### Breaking Changes
* 💥 Drop ruby 2.7 and 3.0 support, and require ruby 3.1 by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/276
* 💥⚡ Simplify `header-fld-name` parser (backward incompatible) by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/216
   For example, `HEADER.FIELDS (Content-Type)` and `HEADER.FIELDS ("Content-Type")` are semantically identical, and a server may choose to return the quoted version.
   * Before this change, the FetchData attr header name would be quoted if the server sent the field name quoted.
   * After this change, the header field names will always be unquoted by the parser, so the result will always available via `fetch_data.header_fields("Content-Type")` or `fetch_data.attr_upcase["HEADER.FIELDS (CONTENT-TYPE)"]`.
* 💥 Replace MessageSet with SequenceSet by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/282
   Most of the changes are bugfixes or allow something new to work that didn't work before.  See [the PR](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/282) for more details.
   This affects `#search`, `#uid_search`, `#sort`, `#uid_sort`, `#fetch`, `#uid_fetch`, `#store`, `#uid_store`, `#copy`, `#uid_copy`, `#move`, `#uid_move`, and `#uid_expunge`.
* 💥 SequenceSet input validation for Set, Array, and enumerables by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/319
   * Array inputs can still be deeply nested.  _This is unchanged._
   * Set inputs can only contain integers and `"*"` or `:*`, to be consistent with `SequenceSet#to_set`.
   * Other `Enumerables` will only be converted if they implement `#to_sequence_set`.
* 🔥 Remove deprecated `#client_thread` attr_reader by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/321
   _`#client_thread` was deprecated by `v0.4.0`._
* 🔥 Drop deprecated BodyType structs by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/323
   _These structs were deprecated by `v0.4.0`._

#### Added
* ✨ Add `#extract_responses` method by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/330 _Also backported to `v0.4.17`._
* ✨ New config option to return frozen dup from `#responses` by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/334 _Also backported to `v0.4.17`._
* 🥅 Improve SequenceSet frozen errors by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/331 _Also backported to `v0.4.17`._
* 📚 SequenceSet API is considered stable now by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/318
* 🔒 Enforce `LOGINDISABLED` requirement by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/307
  To workaround buggy servers, `config.enforce_logindisabled` can be set to `:when_capabilities_cached` or `false`.
* 🔒 SASL DIGEST-MD5: realm, host, service_name, etc by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/284
   _Please note that the `DIGEST-MD5` SASL mechanism is insecure and deprecated._

#### Deprecations
* 🔊 Warn about deprecated `#responses` usage by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/97
   To silence these warnings:
   * pass a block to `#responses` _(supported since `v0.4.0`)_,
   * pass a response type to `#responses` for a frozen copied array _(since `v0.4.17`)_,
   * set `config.responses_without_block` to `:silence_deprecation_warning` _(since `v0.4.13`)_,
   * set `config.responses_without_block` to `:frozen_dup` for a frozen copy _(since `v0.4.17`)_,
   * use `#clear_responses` instead _(since `v0.4.0`)_,
   * use `#extract_responses` instead _(since `v0.4.17`)_.
* 🗑️ Deprecate `MessageSet` by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/282
   `MessageSet` was only intended for internal use, and all internal usage has been replaced.

#### Fixed
* 🐛 Fix #send_data to send DateTime as time by @taku0 in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/313
   _Also backported to `v0.4.15`._

## [v0.4.20](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.4.20) (2025-04-22)

### What's Changed

This release backports two features to prevent unbounded memory use: the `response_handlers` keyword argument to `Net::IMAP.new` so response handlers can be added before the server can send any responses (https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/427), and the `max_response_size` config attribute (https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/445).

> [!NOTE]
> The default `max_response_size` is `nil` (unlimited), to avoid backward compatibility issues with secure connections to trusted servers that are well-behaved. It can be configured more conservatively to guard against untrusted servers (for example, connecting to user-provided hostnames). _It is the responsibility of `net-imap` users to configure their client appropriately for the server they are connecting to._

#### Added
* ✨ Add `response_handlers` kwarg to `Net::IMAP.new` by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/427
  * Backports #419
* ✨ Limit max_response_size by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/445

## [v0.4.19](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.4.19) (2025-02-07)

### What's Changed

#### 🔒 Security Fix
Fixes CVE-2025-25186 (GHSA-7fc5-f82f-cx69): A malicious server can exhaust client memory by sending `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses with very large `uid-set` ranges. `Net::IMAP::UIDPlusData` expands these ranges into arrays of integers.

##### Fix with minor API changes

Set `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data` to `false` to replace `UIDPlusData` with `AppendUIDData` and `CopyUIDData`.  These classes store their UIDs as `Net::IMAP::SequenceSet` objects (_not_ expanded into arrays of integers).  Code that does not handle `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses should not see any difference.  Code that does handle these responses _may_ need to be updated.

For v0.3.8, this option is not available
For v0.4.19, the default value is `true`.
For v0.5.6, the default value is `:up_to_max_size`.
For v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be `false`  _(`UIDPlusData` will be removed from v0.6)_.

##### Mitigate with backward compatible API
Adjust `config.parser_max_deprecated_uidplus_data_size` to limit the maximum `UIDPlusData` UID set size.
When `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == true`, larger sets will crash.
When  `config.parser_use_deprecated_uidplus_data == :up_to_max_size`, larger sets will use `AppendUIDData` or `CopyUIDData`.

For v0.3,8, this limit is _hard-coded_ to 10,000.
For v0.4.19, this limit defaults to 1000.
For v0.5.6, this limit defaults to 100.
For v0.6.0, the only allowed value will be `0`  _(`UIDPlusData` will be removed from v0.6)_.

##### Please Note: unhandled responses
If the client does not add response handlers to prune unhandled responses, a malicious server can still eventually exhaust all client memory, by repeatedly sending malicious responses.  However, `net-imap` has always retained unhandled responses, and it has always been necessary for long-lived connections to prune these responses.  This is not significantly different from connecting to a trusted server with a long-lived connection.  To limit the maximum number of retained responses, a simple handler might look something like the following:

  ```ruby
  limit = 1000
  imap.add_response_handler do |resp|
    next unless resp.respond_to?(:name) && resp.respond_to?(:data)
    name = resp.name
    code = resp.data.code&.name if resp.data.in?(Net::IMAP::ResponseText)
    imap.responses(name) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }
    imap.responses(code) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }
  end
  ```

## [v0.4.2](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.4.2) (2023-10-20)

### What's Changed
* 🔒 SASL: Clarify usage of username vs authcid vs authzid by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/187
  * Improved SASL authenticator parameter documentation.
  * Aliases have been added from `username` to `authcid` or `authzid`—or in the other direction, from `authcid` or `authzd` to `username`.
  * `OAuthBearerAuthenticator` may now receive two arguments, to match the common `authenticate(username, secret)` style.  `authzid` (i.e. `username`) is still optional for the mechanism (although in practice many servers do require it).
  * Instead of raising an exception, conflicting arguments are silently ignored.  This allows more specific arguments (like `authcid` or a keyword argument) to override more generic terms (like `username` or a positional argument).  This improves compatibility with other projects, and can also simplify dynamic mechanism negotiation.
  * Keyword argument support has been added to the deprecated `LOGIN` and `CRAM-MD5` mechanisms.  This is for consistency and compatibility with other projects.  These mechanisms _are obsolete and should be avoided_.
* ✨ Add `secret` alias (for `password`, `oauth2_token`, etc) to relevant SASL mechanisms by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/195

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2


## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.4.1) (2023-10-09)

### What's Changed

* 🔒⚗️ Add experimental SASL::ClientAdapter by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/183
  This code is not yet used by `Net::IMAP#authenticate` (see https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/194).  It is released in experimental form in order to simplify using it from other projects, to facilitate collaborating and iterating on a broadly useful API.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1


## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.4.0) (2023-10-04)

### What's Changed

Most notably, support has been added for the `SASL-IR`, `ENABLE`, and `UTF-8=ACCEPT` extensions, and for many SASL mechanisms: `EXTERNAL`, `ANONYMOUS`, `OAUTHBEARER`, `SCRAM-SHA-1`, and `SCRAM-SHA-256`.

#### 💥 Breaking changes
* 💥 ⬆️ Drop v2.6 support; Require v2.7.3; Use "..." arg by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/89
  The test suite passes under ruby 2.7, although it does print some warnings for experimental pattern matching.
* 💥 Return an empty array (rather than nil) when the server doesn't send any responses, by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/192
  This can affect `list`, `xlist`, `getquota`, `lsub`, `expunge`, `uid_expunge`, `fetch`, `uid_fetch`, `store`, and `uid_store`.

## [v0.3.9](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.3.9) (2025-04-22)

### What's Changed

This release backports two features to prevent unbounded memory use: the `response_handlers` keyword argument to `Net::IMAP.new` so response handlers can be added before the server can send any responses (https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/438), and the `max_response_size` config attribute (https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/446).

> [!NOTE]
> The default `max_response_size` is `nil` (unlimited), to avoid backward compatibility issues with secure connections to trusted servers that are well-behaved. It can be configured more conservatively to guard against untrusted servers (for example, connecting to user-provided hostnames). _It is the responsibility of `net-imap` users to configure their client appropriately for the server they are connecting to._

#### Added
* ✨ Backport `response_handlers`option to `new`  by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/438
  * Backports #419, and #427
* ✨ Limit max_response_size by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/446
  * Backports #444

#### Fixed
* 🐛 Use `Range#size` vs `Range#count` for `uid-set` limit by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/411

#### Documentation
* 📚 Docs: receiver thread, server responses, connection state by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/437
  * Backports #418, and only the documentation from #416.

#### Other Changes
* ♻️ Backport `ResponseReader` by @nevans in https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/pull/439
  * Backports #422, #433, #434, and #435

## [v0.3.8](https://github.com/ruby/net-imap/tree/v0.3.8) (2025-02-07)

### What's Changed

#### 🔒 Security Fix
Mitigates CVE-2025-25186 (GHSA-7fc5-f82f-cx69): A malicious server can exhaust client memory by sending `APPENDUID` or `COPYUID` responses with very large `uid-set` ranges. `Net::IMAP::UIDPlusData` expands these ranges into arrays of integers.

##### Fix with minor API changes
For v0.3.8, this option is not available.  Upgrade to v0.4.19, v0.5.6, or higher to replace `UIDPlusData` with `AppendUIDData` and `CopyUIDData`.  These classes store their UIDs as `Net::IMAP::SequenceSet` objects (_not_ expanded into arrays of integers).

##### Mitigate with backward compatible API
This release mitigates the attack by crashing if a server tries to send a `uid-set` that represents more than 10,000 numbers.  This should be larger than almost all legitimate `COPYUID` or `APPENDUID` responses and would limit the array to only 80KB (on a 64 bit system).

For v0.3.8, this option is not configurable.  Upgrade to v0.4.19, v0.5.6, or higher to configure this limit.

##### Please Note: unhandled responses
If the client does not add response handlers to prune unhandled responses, a malicious server can still eventually exhaust all client memory, by repeatedly sending malicious responses.  However, `net-imap` has always retained unhandled responses, and it has always been necessary for long-lived connections to prune these responses.  This is not significantly different from connecting to a trusted server with a long-lived connection.  To limit the maximum number of retained responses, a simple handler might look something like the following:

  ```ruby
  limit = 1000
  imap.add_response_handler do |resp|
    name = resp.name
    code = resp.data.code&.name if resp.data.in?(Net::IMAP::ResponseText)
    # before 0.4.0:
    imap.responses[name].slice!(0...-limit)
    imap.responses[code].slice!(0...-limit)
    # since 0.4.0:
    imap.responses(name) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }
    imap.responses(code) { _1.slice!(0...-limit) }
  end
  ```
