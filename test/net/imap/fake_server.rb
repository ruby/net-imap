# NOTE: API is experimental and may change without deprecation or warning.
#
# FakeServer is simple fake IMAP server that is used for testing Net::IMAP.  It
# contains simple implementations of many IMAP commands and allows customization
# of server responses.  This allow tests to assume a more-or-less "normal" IMAP
# server implementation, so as to focus on what's important for what's being
# tested without needing to fuss over the details of a TCPServer script.
#
# Although the API is not (yet) stable, Net::IMAP::FakeServer is also intended
# to be useful for testing libraries and applications which themselves use
# Net::IMAP.
#
# ## Limitations
#
# FakeServer cannot be a complete replacement for exploratory testing or
# integration testing with actual IMAP servers.  Simple default behaviors will
# be provided for many commands, and tests may simulate specific server
# responses by assigning handlers (using #on).
#
# And FakeServer is significantly more complex than simply creating a socket IO
# script in a separate thread.  This complexity may obscure the focus of some
# tests or make it more difficult to debug them.  Use with discretion.
#
# Currently, the server will shutdown after a single connection has been
# accepted and closed.  This may change in the future, but only if tests can be
# simplified or made significantly faster by allowing multiple connections to
# the same TCPServer.
